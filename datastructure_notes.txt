[ed: this are some notes I wrote in 2009; I'm keeping them here as they
explain pretty well the original thinking behind the datastructures we 
now have in Sebastian.]


The primary datastructure I've been thinking about for Sebastian is a sequence
of feature structures (or a set of feature structures with time offsets)

Features structures in linguistics aren't really much more than Python
dictionaries (there's a little bit more but not much).

Now of course in Python, we can have objects that are "dictionary-like" so
even if I talk like we'll actually use dictionaries, they may be instances of
some class we write.

Underspecification will play a big role. In other words, these dictionaries
won't always have every value specified. For example, we might have a sequence
of just pitches. Or pitches+rhythm without instrumentation and velocity. Or it
might have detailed velocity and fingering information.

Most of the time we'll be dealing with sequences of these feature structures /
dictionaries, although I have reasons for thinking a set of objects with
offsets might work better than a sequence as the *internal* representation.

Because the dictionaries can be underspecified, I'm not sure it makes sense to
have different types. I think, for example, a rhythm is just a sequence of
dictionaries that are specified for duration but not pitch.

So a rhythm might be:

    [ { duration: 4 }, { duration: 8 } , { duration: 8 }, { duration: 2 } ]

A sequence of pitches might be:

    [ { pitch: c }, { pitch: d }, { pitch: e }, { pitch: g } ]

the two can be merged (what in feature structure terminology is called
unification) to:

    [ { pitch: c, duration: 4 }, { pitch: d, duration: 8 },
      { pitch: e, duration: 8 }, { pitch: g, duration: 2 } ]

One common operation will be applying some factor to an entire sequence to
fill out some underspecification. For example, specifying a tempo allows the
above sequence to be further annotated with time offsets.

The opposite operation is factoring out some property. For example, if you say
that:

    [ { pitch: c, duration: 4 }, { pitch: d, duration: 8 },
      { pitch: e, duration: 8 }, { pitch: g, duration: 2 } ]

is in C, you could factor out the key to get:

    [ { degree: 1, duration: 4 }, { degree: 2, duration: 8 },
      { degree: 3, duration: 8 }, { degree: 5, duration: 2 } ]


Here are some fundamental operations that I think will be important to us:

1. concatenation:

    e.g. [ w, x ] CONCATENATE [ y, z ] => [ w, x, y, z]

2. unification:

    e.g. [ { x: 1 }, { x: 2} ] UNIFY [ { y : 3 }, { y : 4 } ] =>
            [ { x: 1, y: 3 }, { x: 2, y: 4 } ]

3. applying some factor:

    e.g. { key : C } APPLY [ { degree: 1 }, { degree : 3} ] =>
            [ { pitch: c }, { pitch: e} ]

It might be worth thinking of applying a factor might be

    { key : C } APPLY [ { degree: 1 }, { degree : 3} ] =>
    [ { degree: 1, key: C }, { degree 3, key: C } ] =>
    [ { pitch: c }, { pitch: e} ]

or even better, with all information maintained (i.e. make it monotonic):

    { key : C } APPLY  [ { degree: 1 }, { degree : 3} ] =>
    [ { degree: 1, key: C }, { degree 3, key: C } ] =>
    [ { degree: 1, key: C, pitch: c }, { degree 3, key: C, pitch: e} ]

I think there's a 4th operation which is how we indicate two melodies (or
notes) are actually played at the same time. Simultaneous notes is one of a
number of reasons I have for favouring sets with offsets over sequences as the
*internal* representation. That makes it MUCH easier to convey, for example,
that C and E are played at the same time versus one after the other.

Saying two melodies are played together just becomes taking the union of two
sets if offsets are in the feature structures.

Using sets with offsets rather than sequences also allows unification of
sequences with different timing. For example, we might have a sequence that
expresses what beats are to be accented. Unifying that with a rhythm
sequence would be easier if the *internal* representation included offsets and
didn't just rely on the sequence ordering.

Note: I'm fine with using sequences that contain offsets as well. This is a
little redundant but I'm fine with it.

Obviously something like [ { offset: 4 }, { offset : 2 } ] would be illegal.
